			<h1>HI, I'M CYRUS JUDE</h1>

			<h2>CYRUS JUDE E. CARDAÑO</h2>
	
			<p>My full name is Cyrus Jude Esguerra Cardaño. You can call me Cyrus for short.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>I really enjoyed taking CMSC 22 as it introduced me to Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
			<p>Ever since then, I have tremendously improved my abstraction logic and how I see real world objects.</p>
			<br>

			<p>Consequently, I have come to love Java. The versatility, the syntax, the way it presents itself to have</p>
			<p>near-infinite potential--all of that along with numerous others are the reasons why I have come to love it.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>I haven't taken much GE subjects since SAIS never really liked me but I'd go with STS 1 as my favorite</p>
			<p>GE. It touched a lot of topics I was passionate about especially the role of scientific advancement</p>
			<p>in society along with its impact on modern culture.</p>
			<br>


			<p>Lasagna is life. It is filling, it is flavorful, it is pasta and meat combined. Lasagna is cathartic. Q.E.D.</p>

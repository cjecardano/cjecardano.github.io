			<h1>MY AMBITIONS</h1>

			<h2>I ASPIRE TO...</h2>
		
			<p>...travel. I want to see the world and meet people from all echelons of the globe. I want to tell stories</p>
			<p>of my travels as I grow old.</p>
			<br>

			<p>But of course, pure dreaming is not economically sustainable. I need a stable/high-paying job to keep up</p>
			<p>with my hobbies whilst never compromising on primary needs. In that regard, I would like push for a decent</p>
			<p>job that I both enjoy and feel secure in. (Decent boss is optional, as long as the pay is very good)</p>
			<br>

			<p>Of course, all of this is bound to change in the future, either for better or worse. But what's important is to</p>
			<p>have driving factors like these to keep one going, especially during trying times.</p>

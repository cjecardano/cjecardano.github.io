			<h1>MY HOBBIES</h1>

			<h2>I ENJOY DOING...</h2>

			<p>I love sleep. I love sleeping and its variants: oversleeping and undersleeping.</p>
			<br>

			<p>This may come as a surprise but I do love studying at my own pace. Recently, I've</p>
			<p>taken an interest on international culture and I do like exploring at my own pace.</p>
			<br>

			<p>The pandemic has hampered my ability to eat anywhere I would like to. I love eating</p>
			<p>and I love tasting food. But nothing too exotic, okay?</p>
			<br>

			<p>I do enjoy some games. In fact, I have an unhealthy habit of playing 24/7 whenever I get</p>
			<p>really hooked on a game. So for the most part, I just enjoy casual games and stay away</p>
			<p>from immersive games even though they're good.</p>
			<br>

			<p>I also have an unhealthy obsession with cleaning. Whenever I get stressed back at the dorm,</p>
			<p>I can't help but tinker, rearrange, and clean anything I can see in order to avoid my acedemic</p>
			<p>responsibilities.</p>
